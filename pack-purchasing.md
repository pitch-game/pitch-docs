# Pack Purchasing

As a User I want to be able to purchase packs with my in-game currency.

- [[store-microservice]] is responsible for building a payment request and sending it to the [[user-microservice]].

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[store]: store "Store"
[user]: user "User"
[user-microservice]: user-microservice "User Microservice"
[store-microservice]: store-microservice "Store Microservice"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
