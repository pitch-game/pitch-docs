# Pack Purchasing

[[user]]s are able to purchase [[player-packs]] using their in-game [[currency]].

- The [[store-microservice]] is responsible for building a payment request and sending it to the [[user-microservice]]. In return it will receive a payment response to denote if the payment was successful.
  - On successful payment the [[store-microservice]] will create a new pack record for the associated [[user]].
